<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://sano-jin.github.io/meetup-town/)

Due to the influence of COVID-19, the social value of online communication tools is increasing more than ever.
Therefore, we will contribute to society by creating online conferencing tools that are
(1) open source, and
(2) simple and highly extensible.

### Built With

Some major frameworks that we used to built our project. 
* [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
